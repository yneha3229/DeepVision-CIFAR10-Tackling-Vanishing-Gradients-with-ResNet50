# DeepVision-CIFAR10-Tackling-Vanishing-Gradients-with-ResNet50
A deep learning project using ResNet50 on CIFAR-10 to tackle vanishing gradients and boost accuracy

This project explores the challenge of vanishing and exploding gradients in deep neural networks,
particularly with increasing depth. By leveraging Residual Networks (ResNet50), we achieve a 
significant accuracy of 81% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The architectureâ€™s skip connections effectively
address the degradation problem, enabling deeper and more accurate models for image classification.

## Highlights
- Implemented ResNet50 using PyTorch on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Investigated training instability due to gradient vanishing in deep networks.
- Achieved 81% test accuracy with proper data augmentation and optimization strategies.
